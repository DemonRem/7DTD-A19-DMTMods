# 7DTD-A19-DMTMods
A collection of DMT mods for 7 Days to Die Alpha 19

I used the latest release of DMT which can be found here: https://github.com/HAL-NINE-THOUSAND/DMT/releases

I then copied over the latest 0Harmony.dll(version 2.0.2) into the DMT folder from here: https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/releases

As always, I'm located in Guppy's Discord Server if you have any questions.

Cheers!
